# MYHTML

A small collection of HTML practice files created while learning hands-on coding from freeCodeCamp.

This repository contains simple HTML (and optionally CSS/JS) examples and exercises built to practice core web fundamentals: document structure, semantic elements, linking assets, forms, images, and basic styling.

## What you'll find here
- Simple standalone `.html` pages you can open directly in a browser
- Example layout and styling files (CSS) if present
- Small interactive examples (JavaScript) if present
- Notes or comments in the HTML files to explain what I learned

> Built while following freeCodeCamp hands-on coding exercises — these files document my learning progress.


## What I learned
- Basic HTML document structure (doctype, head, body)
- Semantic tags (header, nav, main, section, footer)
- Linking CSS and JS files
- Embedding images and media
- Basic responsive layout and forms

## Credits
- freeCodeCamp — for the hands-on exercises and guided practice that inspired these files.
